# react-insta

I created this instagram clone as part of the Code Nation, Software Development Bootcamp. 

# Brief: 

1. Creat a basic React social media site that mimics Instagram.
2. Use the Unsplash API to randomly grab images and render them using the map() method.
3. Stretch goal - Simulate the login process and have multiple pages.

Wow, probably the best Instagram clone, I have had the pleasure to have marked. What is particularly impressive is that you have independently researched features such as Firebase and made them work without requiring support. The ability to research new products independently is a key skill for any junior developer.  
EBI:
This amazing piece of React software would have been even better if you connect to the backend server you built during week 9 as the will give you practice in using the fetch method. Also documenting your code is great for deepening your understanding of your own code. Finally the icing on the cake would be to get this hosted so I finally see what Cuthbert is up to when my back is turned!
Overall an amazing app that you should be rightly proud of. However, your focus for the next two weeks has to be the Project but after it will be worth going back and revisiting the suggestions above.
